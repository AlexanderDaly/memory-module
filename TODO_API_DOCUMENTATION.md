# API Documentation Todo List (Improvement Task 1.1)

- [ ] Add `///` doc comments to all public items (functions, structs, enums, modules, etc.)
- [ ] Include usage examples in documentation comments for key public APIs
    - [ ] Examples should be runnable with `cargo test` (i.e., be valid doctests)
- [ ] Document error conditions for each fallible public API function
- [ ] Document potential panics for public API functions (if any, and why they might occur)
- [ ] Add `#![warn(missing_docs)]` to the main library crate file (e.g., `lib.rs` or `main.rs`) to enforce documentation coverage.
    - [ ] Address all new warnings generated by this attribute.
- [ ] Configure `cargo doc` to generate documentation.
    - [ ] Ensure all public items are included.
    - [ ] Check for any broken links or rendering issues in the generated documentation.
- [ ] Plan for publishing documentation (e.g., to docs.rs, GitHub Pages, or a project website).
    - [ ] Set up CI/CD to automatically build and publish documentation on new releases/tags.
