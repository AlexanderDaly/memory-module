# API Documentation Todo List (Improvement Task 1.1)

- [x] Add `///` doc comments to all public items (functions, structs, enums, modules, etc.)
- [x] Include usage examples in documentation comments for key public APIs
    - [x] Examples should be runnable with `cargo test` (i.e., be valid doctests)
- [x] Document error conditions for each fallible public API function
- [x] Document potential panics for public API functions (if any, and why they might occur)
- [x] Add `#![warn(missing_docs)]` to the main library crate file (e.g., `lib.rs` or `main.rs`) to enforce documentation coverage.
    - [x] Address all new warnings generated by this attribute.
- [x] Configure `cargo doc` to generate documentation.
    - [x] Ensure all public items are included.
    - [x] Check for any broken links or rendering issues in the generated documentation.
- [x] Plan for publishing documentation (e.g., to docs.rs, GitHub Pages, or a project website).
    - [x] Set up CI/CD to automatically build and publish documentation on new releases/tags.
