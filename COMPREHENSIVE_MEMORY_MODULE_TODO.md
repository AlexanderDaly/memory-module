- [ ] Implement batch processing for bulk similarity search operations
- [ ] Evaluate and compare different indexing strategies (e.g., IVFADC, SCANN)

## 3. Persistence Layer

### 3.1 Serialization
- [ ] Add `serde` support for all core types
- [ ] Implement `Save`/`Load` traits for the main memory store and components
- [ ] Add support for multiple storage backends (local file, object storage, databases)

### 3.2 Database Integration
- [ ] Add feature flags for different database backends (SQLite, PostgreSQL/MySQL)

- [ ] Implement connection pooling for database connections
- [ ] Utilize asynchronous database operations

## 4. Memory Management

### 4.1 Eviction Policies
- [ ] Implement multiple eviction strategies (LRU, LFU, FIFO, TTL, etc.)
- [ ] Allow users to configure and combine eviction policies
- [ ] Add memory usage limits (total size, item count) with configurable actions (evict, warn)
- [ ] Implement compression for long-term or less frequently accessed memories
- [ ] Make eviction policies pluggable for custom strategies

### 4.2 Memory Hierarchies
- [ ] Implement multi-level memory hierarchy (L1, L2, L3 for hot/warm/cold)
- [ ] Add memory consolidation and promotion/demotion mechanisms between levels
- [ ] Support different memory types (episodic, semantic, procedural)
- [ ] Define clear transition rules and triggers for memory movement between levels

## 5. Testing Strategy

### 5.1 Test Coverage
- [ ] Add property-based tests (`proptest`, `quickcheck`) for core algorithms/data structures
- [ ] Improve integration test coverage for component interactions
- [ ] Add benchmark tests (`criterion.rs`) to track performance and prevent regressions
- [ ] Aim for high code coverage (>80-90%) using `cargo-tarpaulin` or `grcov`
- [ ] Include tests for edge cases, error conditions, and invalid inputs

### 5.2 Fuzz Testing
- [ ] Add `cargo-fuzz` integration for public APIs and parsing logic
- [ ] Fuzz test critical paths (serialization, deserialization, complex data manipulation)
- [ ] Add crash reporting and analysis for fuzzing findings
- [ ] Develop and maintain a corpus of interesting inputs for fuzzing

## 6. Error Handling

### 6.1 Error Types
- [ ] Create comprehensive and specific error types for different failure modes
- [ ] Implement `std::error::Error` and `Display` for all custom error types
- [ ] Add error conversion traits (`From`) for composing errors
- [ ] Improve error context and reporting (stack traces, diagnostic info in debug)
- [ ] Utilize `thiserror` or `eyre` for idiomatic error handling

## 7. Configuration System

### 7.1 Runtime Configuration
- [ ] Add `config` crate integration (or similar) for loading configuration
- [ ] Support environment variables for overriding configuration
- [ ] Add validation for configuration values
- [ ] Support multiple configuration file formats (TOML, YAML, JSON)
- [ ] Provide clear documentation for all configuration options
- [ ] Allow for hot-reloading of configuration where appropriate

## 8. Observability

### 8.1 Logging
- [ ] Add `tracing` integration for structured, context-aware logging
- [ ] Add structured logging (e.g., JSON) for easier parsing
- [ ] Support configurable log levels and filters
- [ ] Correlate logs with traces and metrics using shared IDs
- [ ] Document logging conventions and message interpretation

### 8.2 Metrics
- [ ] Add `metrics` crate (or similar) for application metrics
- [ ] Track key metrics (memory usage, query latency, hit/miss rates, error rates, queue lengths)
- [ ] Add Prometheus exporter or support for other metrics backends
- [ ] Create dashboards (e.g., Grafana) for visualizing metrics
- [ ] Define alerts based on critical metric thresholds

## 9. API Improvements

### 9.1 Batch Operations
- [ ] Add batch insert, update, delete, and query methods
- [ ] Implement a streaming API for large result sets
- [ ] Ensure atomicity or clear error handling for batch operations (partial success, rollback)

### 9.2 Query Language
- [ ] Add a simple query builder API
- [ ] Support filtering by metadata, sorting, and pagination
- [ ] Add full-text search capabilities
- [ ] Consider a more expressive query language (custom DSL, SQL/GraphQL subset) if needed
- [ ] Optimize query execution paths

## 10. Security

### 10.1 Input Validation
- [ ] Add comprehensive input validation for API endpoints and configuration
- [ ] Add fuzz testing targeting security vulnerabilities and parser exploits
- [ ] Follow Rust security best practices (avoid `unsafe`, use safe APIs, handle errors)
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for API endpoints (if exposed as a service)
- [ ] Consider authentication/authorization for remote or multi-tenant access
- [ ] Regularly audit dependencies (`cargo-audit`, `cargo-deny`)
- [ ] Sanitize outputs to prevent XSS if memory content is rendered
