# Agent Instructions for Documentation Tasks

## General Guidelines

- All agents working on tasks outlined in `TODO_API_DOCUMENTATION.md` are required to adhere to the following protocol.

## Task Completion Protocol

1.  **Identify Your Task**: Select a task from the `TODO_API_DOCUMENTATION.md` file.
2.  **Complete the Task**: Perform the work as described in the task item.
3.  **Mark as Done**: Upon completion, you **MUST** update the `TODO_API_DOCUMENTATION.md` file by marking the checkbox for the completed task.
    -   Example: Change `[ ] Task description` to `[x] Task description`.
4.  **Commit Changes**: Ensure that the updated `TODO_API_DOCUMENTATION.md` file is included in your commit if changes to the documentation file are part of a larger set of code changes.

## Importance

-   Checking off tasks is crucial for tracking progress, avoiding duplicated effort, and maintaining clarity on the remaining work.
-   Failure to update the to-do list may lead to confusion and misallocation of resources.
