# Agent Instructions for Project Tasks

## General Guidelines

- All agents working on tasks outlined in any project-related to-do list Markdown file (e.g., `COMPREHENSIVE_MEMORY_MODULE_TODO.md`, `TODO_ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION.md`, etc.) are required to adhere to the protocols outlined in this document.
- Before starting work on a new major task category (e.g., "Performance Optimizations", "Persistence Layer"), check if a specific `TODO_<TASK_NAME>.md` file exists for it. If so, refer to that specialized to-do list.
- If a specialized to-do list does not exist for a major task, refer to the main `COMPREHENSIVE_MEMORY_MODULE_TODO.md`.
- Always ensure you are working from the latest version of any to-do list file.

## Task Completion Protocol

1.  **Identify Your Task**: Select a task from the `TODO_API_DOCUMENTATION.md` file.
2.  **Complete the Task**: Perform the work as described in the task item.
3.  **Mark as Done**: Upon completion, you **MUST** update the `TODO_API_DOCUMENTATION.md` file by marking the checkbox for the completed task.
    -   Example: Change `[ ] Task description` to `[x] Task description`.
4.  **Commit Changes**: Ensure that the updated `TODO_API_DOCUMENTATION.md` file is included in your commit if changes to the documentation file are part of a larger set of code changes.

## Importance

-   Checking off tasks is crucial for tracking progress, avoiding duplicated effort, and maintaining clarity on the remaining work.
-   Failure to update the to-do list may lead to confusion and misallocation of resources.
