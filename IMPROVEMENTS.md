# Memory Module Improvement Plan
## 0. Project Hygiene
- Adopt conventional commits and semantic-release for automated changelogs
- Add `cargo clippy --deny warnings` and `rustfmt` checks in CI
- Define an RFC process under `docs/rfcs/` for future proposals


## 1. Documentation Improvements

### 1.1 API Documentation
- **Issue**: Missing comprehensive documentation for public APIs.
- **Impact**: Makes the library harder to use and maintain.
- **Solution**:
  - Add `///` doc comments to all public items
  - Include usage examples in documentation
  - Document error conditions and panics
  - Add `#![warn(missing_docs)]` to enforce documentation
  - Generate documentation using `cargo doc` and ensure it's published (e.g., to docs.rs or a project website)

### 1.2 Architecture Documentation
- **Issue**: No high-level architecture documentation.
- **Impact**: New contributors struggle to understand the system design.
- **Solution**:
  - Add `ARCHITECTURE.md` explaining the core concepts, components, and their interactions
  - Document the memory retention algorithm in detail, including its trade-offs
  - Add data flow diagrams for key processes (e.g., memory insertion, retrieval, eviction)
  - Add sequence diagrams for common API interactions
  - Add a "Decision Log" section to ARCHITECTURE.md for recording major trade-offs

## 2. Performance Optimizations

### 2.1 Data Structures
- **Issue**: Using basic `HashMap` for memory storage.
- **Impact**: Suboptimal for large-scale memory systems.
- **Solution**:
  - Consider using `DashMap` or other concurrent hash maps for thread-safe access without coarse-grained locking
  - Implement memory sharding or partitioning for better parallelism and scalability
  - Add benchmarking to measure performance improvements of different data structures
  - Profile memory usage and CPU hotspots to identify bottlenecks in current data structures
  - Evaluate arena or bump allocation for transient objects to reduce allocation overhead
  - Consider lock-free ring buffers (e.g., crossbeam) for hot writer â†’ reader hand-offs

### 2.2 Similarity Search
- **Issue**: Naive cosine similarity implementation.
- **Impact**: Inefficient for large memory stores.
- **Solution**:
  - Integrate FAISS, HNSWlib, or other optimized libraries for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search
  - Add SIMD optimizations for vector operations (e.g., using `packed_simd` or architecture-specific intrinsics)
  - Implement batch processing for bulk similarity search operations
  - Evaluate and compare different indexing strategies (e.g., IVFADC, SCANN) for trade-offs in speed, accuracy, and memory usage
  - Add GPU path toggle (faiss-gpu / cuBLAS) for large deployments
  - Explore vector quantisation or product quantisation for memory-constrained edge devices

## 3. Persistence Layer

### 3.1 Serialization
- **Issue**: No built-in persistence.
- **Impact**: Memory store is lost on process termination.
- **Solution**:
  - Add `serde` support for all core types to enable serialization/deserialization
  - Implement `Save`/`Load` traits for the main memory store and its components
  - Add support for multiple storage backends (e.g., local file system, object storage, databases)
  - Implement data format versioning to handle changes in data structures over time and ensure backward/forward compatibility
  - Add Zstd or Brotli compression toggle at the file-storage layer
  - Encrypt at rest using AES-GCM (via `ring`) with a pluggable key provider

### 3.2 Database Integration
- **Issue**: No database support.
- **Impact**: Limited to in-memory storage, not suitable for large or persistent datasets.
- **Solution**:
  - Add feature flags for different database backends (e.g., SQLite for embedded, PostgreSQL/MySQL for server-based)
  - Implement a `StorageBackend` trait to abstract database interactions
  - Add a migration system (e.g., using `sqlx-macros` or `diesel_migrations`) for schema changes
  - Implement connection pooling for efficient database connection management
  - Utilize asynchronous database operations for non-blocking persistence
  - Provide schema diagrams in `docs/schema/` auto-generated from migrations
  - Add a WASM-friendly storage backend (e.g., IndexedDB) for browser deployments

## 4. Memory Management

### 4.1 Eviction Policies
- **Issue**: Only basic retention-based pruning.
- **Impact**: Limited control over memory usage and relevance of stored items.
- **Solution**:
  - Implement multiple eviction strategies (LRU, LFU, FIFO, time-to-live (TTL), etc.)
  - Allow users to configure and combine eviction policies
  - Add memory usage limits (total size, item count) with configurable actions (evict, warn)
  - Implement compression for long-term storage or less frequently accessed memories
  - Make eviction policies pluggable, allowing users to define custom strategies
  - Implement "biological-style decay" (power-law with rehearsal boost)
  - Add reservoir sampling mode for unbiased long-tail retention

### 4.2 Memory Hierarchies
- **Issue**: Flat memory structure.
- **Impact**: No distinction between short/long-term memories or varying access speed requirements.
- **Solution**:
  - Implement multi-level memory hierarchy (e.g., L1 for hot/recent, L2 for warm/older, L3 for cold/archived)
  - Add memory consolidation and promotion/demotion mechanisms between hierarchy levels
  - Support for different memory types (episodic, semantic, procedural) with distinct storage and retrieval characteristics
  - Define clear transition rules and triggers for moving memories between hierarchy levels (e.g., based on access frequency, age, relevance)
  - Support distributed tier (remote cold store, S3 / GCS) with async prefetch

## 5. Testing Strategy

### 5.1 Test Coverage
- **Issue**: Basic test coverage.
- **Impact**: Risk of regressions and undiscovered bugs.
- **Solution**:
  - Add property-based tests (e.g., using `proptest` or `quickcheck`) for core algorithms and data structures
  - Improve integration test coverage to ensure components work together correctly
  - Add benchmark tests (e.g., using `criterion.rs`) to track performance and prevent regressions
  - Aim for a high code coverage target (e.g., >80-90%) and use tools like `cargo-tarpaulin` or `grcov` to measure and track it
  - Include tests for edge cases, error conditions, and invalid inputs
  - Add mutation testing using `mutagen` to complement fuzzing
  - Stress test under simulated multi-threaded contention using `loom`

### 5.2 Fuzz Testing
- **Issue**: No fuzz testing.
- **Impact**: Potential for edge case bugs, crashes, or security vulnerabilities when handling unexpected inputs.
- **Solution**:
  - Add `cargo-fuzz` integration for fuzz testing public APIs and parsing logic
  - Fuzz test critical paths, especially those involving serialization, deserialization, and complex data manipulation
  - Add crash reporting and analysis for fuzzing findings
  - Develop and maintain a corpus of interesting inputs for fuzz testing to guide the fuzzer towards problematic areas

## 6. Error Handling

### 6.1 Error Types
- **Issue**: Basic error handling.
- **Impact**: Poor error messages, difficult debugging, and limited recovery options.
- **Solution**:
  - Create comprehensive and specific error types for different failure modes
  - Implement `std::error::Error` and `Display` for all custom error types
  - Add error conversion traits (`From`) for composing errors from underlying libraries
  - Improve error context and reporting, possibly including stack traces or diagnostic information in debug builds
  - Utilize a library like `thiserror` for boilerplate-free custom error definitions or `eyre` for rich error reports
  - Consider using `tracing-error::SpanTrace` for rich backtraces

## 7. Configuration System

### 7.1 Runtime Configuration
- **Issue**: Limited configuration options.
- **Impact**: Inflexible for different use cases and deployment environments.
- **Solution**:
  - Add `config` crate integration for loading configuration from files, environment variables, and other sources
  - Support environment variables for overriding specific configuration values
  - Add validation for configuration values to prevent misconfiguration
  - Support multiple configuration file formats (e.g., TOML, YAML, JSON)
  - Provide clear documentation for all configuration options and their effects
  - Allow for hot-reloading of configuration where appropriate
  - Ship `serde`-derived config structs for compile-time validation in embedding apps
  - Provide feature-gated default profiles (dev, prod, embedded)

## 8. Observability

### 8.1 Logging
- **Issue**: No structured logging.
- **Impact**: Difficult to debug issues in production and analyze system behavior.
- **Solution**:
  - Add `tracing` integration for structured, context-aware logging
  - Add structured logging (e.g., JSON format) for easier parsing and analysis by log management systems
  - Support configurable log levels and filters to control verbosity
  - Correlate logs with traces and metrics using shared identifiers (e.g., trace IDs)
  - Document logging conventions and how to interpret log messages

### 8.2 Metrics
- **Issue**: No metrics collection.
- **Impact**: No insight into system performance, resource usage, or operational health.
- **Solution**:
  - Add the `metrics` crate or a similar facade for collecting application metrics
  - Track key metrics such as memory usage, query latency, hit/miss rates, error rates, and queue lengths
  - Add a Prometheus exporter or support for other common metrics backends (e.g., InfluxDB, Datadog)
  - Create dashboards (e.g., using Grafana) for visualizing key metrics and system health
  - Define alerts based on critical metric thresholds
  - Add latency percentiles (histograms) by memory tier
  - Expose an OpenTelemetry exporter to unify traces and metrics

## 9. API Improvements

### 9.1 Batch Operations
- **Issue**: Only single-item operations.
- **Impact**: Inefficient for bulk operations, leading to high network overhead and slower processing.
- **Solution**:
  - Add batch insert, update, delete, and query methods to the API
  - Implement a streaming API for large result sets to avoid high memory consumption
  - Ensure atomicity or clear error handling semantics for batch operations (e.g., partial success, rollback)
  - Use zero-copy streaming via `bytes::Bytes` to avoid unnecessary allocations

### 9.2 Query Language
- **Issue**: Limited query capabilities.
- **Impact**: Hard to express complex queries or retrieve specific subsets of data efficiently.
- **Solution**:
  - Add a simple query builder API for constructing queries programmatically
  - Support filtering by metadata, sorting by various attributes, and pagination of results
  - Add full-text search capabilities for text-based memory content
  - Consider a more expressive query language (e.g., a custom DSL or a subset of a known standard like SQL or GraphQL) if complex querying becomes a common requirement
  - Ship a playground CLI (`memoryctl`) for ad-hoc queries and profiling
  - Optimize query execution paths

## 10. Security

### 10.1 Input Validation
- **Issue**: Minimal input validation.
- **Impact**: Potential security vulnerabilities such as DoS, data corruption, or injection attacks.
- **Solution**:
  - Add comprehensive input validation for all API endpoints and configuration parameters
  - Add fuzz testing specifically targeting security vulnerabilities and parser exploits
  - Follow Rust security best practices (e.g., avoid `unsafe` where possible, use safe APIs, handle errors correctly)
  - Implement rate limiting for API endpoints if exposed as a service
  - Consider authentication and authorization mechanisms if the memory module is accessed remotely or by multiple tenants
  - Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities (e.g., using `cargo-audit` or `cargo-deny`)
  - Sanitize outputs to prevent XSS or other injection attacks if memory content is rendered elsewhere
  - Provide a GDPR "forget me" helper to purge data, embeddings, and index entries
  - Add a supply-chain policy using `cargo-vet` and `sigstore` for dependency attestation

## 11. Cross-Language Bindings
- Generate Python bindings with `pyo3`/`maturin` for Jupyter users
- Generate Node bindings via `napi-rs` for serverless or edge JS
- Publish pre-built wheels in CI to ease adoption

## 12. Deployment & Packaging
- Provide Docker images (alpine and debian) with minimal attack surface
- Ship Helm charts and Kubernetes manifests for cloud deployments
- Support `memoryd` microservice mode versus in-process library mode
